This tree can contain links to whole ThreatMark  wtitten in **mardown**. Whole book can look somewhat like this [HackMD Tutorials Book](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Ftutorials). It can be edited by multiple users with markup being tracked. Visibility of the each page can be set as needed.

*Visibility of the each page can be set as needed.*

*Separate notes can be uploaded to **GitHub** repositories when relevant. Compared to confluence it is better suited for usage by developers.*

## Outstanding questions:
- Does/can ThreatMark use GitHub?
- Can ThreatMark use solution that is online hosted by HackMD?
- Can we run HackMD privately on our own server?
- [Security page of HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@PHD/HJoWJWBlH)

## Alternative solution
Stick with Confluence
